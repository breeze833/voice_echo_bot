# Demonstration Scripts for Raspberry Pi + ReSpeaker Hat

This folder contains the scripts that work on my specific configuration:
 * Raspberry Pi 3 (Model A)
 * 2-Mic ReSpeaker Hat

[![ReSpeaker Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Ow0oNdXwec4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0oNdXwec4 "ReSpeaker Echo Bot")

## `echo_bot_gcp.py`

This script uses the google cloud STT and TTS. The recording trigger is the button on the ReSpeaker Hat and the recording indicator is the LEDs.

## `echo_bot_espeak.py`

This script uses the eSpeak to synthesize the speech locally.
